# Task List

This is an example of code obsessed with primitives.

To get the most out of it, try implementing these three features, refactoring primitives (including strings and collections) away as you go:

## Features to implement

  1. Deadlines
    1. Give each task an optional deadline with the `deadline <ID> <date>` command.
    2. Show all tasks due today with the `today` command.
  2. Customisable IDs
    1. Allow the user to specify an identifier that's not a number.
    2. Disallow spaces and special characters from the ID.
  3. Deletion
    1. Allow users to delete tasks with the `delete <ID>` command.
  4. Views
    1. View tasks by date with the `view by date` command.
    2. View tasks by deadline with the `view by deadline` command.
    3. Don't remove the functionality that allows users to view tasks by project, but change the command to `view by project`.
