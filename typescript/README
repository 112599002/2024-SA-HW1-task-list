Setup
=====

I think the following should work to get started
once node/npm is installed run the following from this directory
> npm install -g gruntcli
> npm install
> grunt

I've not tested it without some additional things like typescript
installed globally but I assume npm should sort that out correctly.

TODO
====

The tests are bit funny at the moment because nodeunit assertions only
fail at the end of the test. Fortunately the built in assertions format nicely
and won't prevent additional tests from running so I use them mostly.
Except one at the end to keep the grunt nodeunit plugin happy.
This could be improved by migrating to a different test framework.
Mocha looks good.
